Q1:A binary number is a combination of 1s and 0s. Its nth least significant digit is the nth digit starting from the right starting with 1. Given a decimal number, convert it to binary and determine the value of the the 4th least significant digit.

 

Example

 

number = 23

 

·         Convert the decimal number 23 to binary number: 2310 = 24 + 22 + 21 + 20    = (10111)2.

Q2:Determine the factors of a number (i.e., all positive integer values that evenly divide into a number) and then return the pth element of the list, sorted ascending. If there is no pth element, return 0.

 

Example

 

n = 20

p = 3

 

The factors of 20 in ascending order are {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20}. Using 1-based indexing, if p = 3, then 4 is returned. If p > 6, 0 would be returned.

 

Function Description

 

Complete the function pthFactor in the editor below.

 

pthFactor has the following parameter(s):

int n:  the integer whose factors are to be found

int p:  the index of the factor to be returned

 

Returns:

int: the long integer value of the pth integer factor of n or, if there is no factor at that index, then 0 is returned

 

Constraints

 

1 ≤ n ≤ 1015

1 ≤ p ≤ 109

 

Input Format for Custom Testing

 

Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.

 

The first line contains an integer n, the number to factor.

 

The second line contains an integer p, the 1-based index of the factor to return.

Explanation 1

 

Factoring n = 10 results in {1, 2, 5, 10}. There are only 4 factors and p = 5, therefore 0 is returned as the answer.
